What to Bring
**Please answer the following questions. Take at least 30 minutes to prepare.

Approach and Process
What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
**I would think about my current skillsets and do a more realistic project that I can handle from the start.


What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
**I learnt a very important mindset; learning to accept that there are just some things that I can't achieve, and taking the courage to change when needed.
I would definitely think carefully before diving into a project and not overestimate myself next time.

Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
**I would try to make my project appearance better and more lively the next time.


What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
**I like the flow and presentation of my project. I tend to think and try to have a visual overview of the whole coding flow in my head. This would normally work in a small assignment or project, but I realised this method of mine cannot be used for bigger projects in the future. I need to break down parts to do step by step in the future.
I won't put code snippets but just generally I would like to clean up my code more and try to put loose parts into functions

WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
**My ever focused and detailed habit

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
**Always pushing too hard to challenge myself and over estimating the timeline. 

How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
I felt that the course materials and what is expected of us in the real world outside is not very on par. Would be good to learn more on the real world aspects.
